# How to contribute?
We use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) to contribute.
1. Create a topic branch
3. Prepare Pull Request
   - Try not to close/abandon PR. Just improve it to the needed condition with additional commit.
   - Assign 2 teammates as a reviewer. Otherwise, it will be done automatically for you.
   - One of mentors will also be assigned automatically.
   - Enable automatic merge. Once your PR is satisfactory, GitHub will automatically merge it.
   - Link the PR to the related issue. Once PR is successfully merged, the related issue will be closed automatically.
   - The topic branch will be automatically deleted from the origin.
4. PROFIT!

Periodically, check for PR review requests. Kindly, review PRs from your teammates.
